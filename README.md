# Updates After the Presentation:
- Added videos for the application that also includes newly implemented features.
- **Table Section:** Add a search bar functionality to Table Section. You can search by the element symbol or name (we can easily configure for searchings by other properties like the discoverer of the element or something else.) and when you press the search button, the element dialog opens as when you click directly to an element.
- **Quiz Section:** Improved GUI for the Quiz Section (we firstly implement the GUI of the quiz section quiz section by just coding. Now the GUI transferred to form file). The level dialog and challange dialog still exist since we want to show the implementation of GUI by both form files and coding.
- **Quiz Section:** The highest score holder is now in a txt file. When you close the application, the highest score data will still exist.
- Code improvements: Now we have cleaner and more efficient code.
- Added doxygen documentation lines.
- Since we have completed the core application, we can easily add new features and sections.

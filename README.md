# Introduction

This is a four-member group project for the Object-Oriented Programming course. The application allows you to choose an appropriate coloring based on the selected periodic table property. The GUI enables interaction with the periodic table by clicking on elements directly or by searching for them using the search bar. The project encompasses the software development process (analysis, design, development, and documentation).

# Updates After the Presentation:

- Added videos for the application that also includes newly implemented features.
- **Table Section:** Add a search bar functionality to Table Section. You can search by the element symbol or name (we can easily configure for searchings by other properties like the discoverer of the element or something else.) and when you press the search button, the element dialog opens as when you click directly to an element.
- **Quiz Section:** Improved GUI for the Quiz Section (we firstly implement the GUI of the quiz section quiz section by just coding. Now the GUI of the quiz section is transferred to form file). LevelDialog and ChallengeDialog classes no longer exist. Their function is fulfilled by the QuizSection class
- **Quiz Section:** Scores are now in txt file. When you close the application, the scores will still be available.
- Added doxygen documentation lines.
- Since we have completed the core application, we can easily add new features and sections.

In this stage, you need to refine and complete your designs. 

Each group needs to generate a complete class diagram. This should include all classes, methods, and relations.

You can use the report template from the analysis stage (PS2). The sections need to include:

    - Cover page
    - Introduction: Summarize your project and introduce the report, what are the report's contents
    - Class-responsibility-collaboration (CRC) cards: Checking your analysis and requirements, generate CRC cards for each of your classes.
    - Class Diagram: Put your complete class diagram. If it takes too much space, you can show all relations without class details with one diagram and show details of each class separately on other pages.
    - Conclusion: Conclude the report and mention the contributions of each group member

Good luck!

In this report, we created an outline of the project. We decided which sections will be in the project, how these sections will be designed and how the general interface will look like. We wrote 2 use cases related to the project and created an object and class model based on them. When we were designing the project, we agreed that everyone would work collaboratively in all phases of the project in the later stages of the project.
